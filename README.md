# soduku-solver-using-image

This project is a Sudoku Solver that uses image processing techniques with OpenCV and a pre-trained model to recognize and solve Sudoku puzzles from images. The project leverages TensorFlow for digit recognition and NumPy for various numerical operations.

**Features**

Detects Sudoku grid from an image
Recognizes and extracts digits from the grid using a pre-trained model
Solves the Sudoku puzzle
Overlays the solution on the original image

**Requirements**
To run this project, you will need the following libraries:

Python 3.x
OpenCV
TensorFlow
NumPy
